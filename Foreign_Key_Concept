Foreign key is used to link one or more table together. So, it is also called as "Referencing key".
In a table, there can be single or multiple foreign keys based on the requirement that how many tables to be linked.
We can add foreign key in 2 ways- while creating table and also by altering the existing table later.
We can drop/delete foreign key by altering the table.
Foreign key matches the primary key field/column of another table. (unique key will be considered if there is no primary key)
It means, foreign key field in one table referes to primary key field of other table.
Foreign key identifies each row of another table uniquely that matches REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY.
primary key is defined in parent table(table1) and foreign key is defined in child table(table2).
Parent table holds the initial column values and the column values of child table refers to parent table column values.
Optionals: Reference options- used to ensure how foreign key maintains referential integrity using ON DELETE & ON UPDATE clauses between parent & child table.
there are many tyepes of Reference options we can define as follows,
CASCADE- used when we delete (ON DELETE CASCADE) or update (ON UPDATE CASCADE) any row from parent table, then the values of matching rows in child table also will get deleted/updated automatically.
